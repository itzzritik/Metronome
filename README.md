# Polyrhythmic Metronome

The creation of this mesmerizing spiral effect with polyrhythms was inspired by the impressive work of [@project_jdm](https://youtube.com/c/project_jdm) on YouTube. I developed it from scratch using NextJS on a canvas, with meticulous attention to detail. 

## Reverse-Engineering and Unique Twist

Essentially, I reverse-engineered the effect from @project_jdm's captivating video, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/4GaGnU8Ij2Y), pushing my skills to their limits. I then added my own unique twist, infusing the creation with my personal touch. The process demanded a considerable investment of time, effort, and unwavering dedication.

## Exploring Polyrhythms

Before stumbling upon @project_jdm's groundbreaking content, the concept of polyrhythms eluded me. Determined to grasp its essence, I turned to ChatGPT for guidance. I asked ChatGPT to explain polyrhythms in a way that a 5-year-old would understand. Here's what it said:

>You know when you're on a swing? Imagine there are two swings side by side. Your friend is swinging three times for every two times you swing. So, sometimes you're at the top together, but other times, you're not. When you're both at the top at the same time, that's like a polyrhythm in music. Two different beats, syncing up at special moments.

## Customizable Parameters

To facilitate ease of modification, I've provided a settings object below. It outlines several parameters, including start time, total duration, and the number of cycles, enabling effortless customization of the effect's core features.

## Captivating Sound Effects

In my pursuit of the perfect sound effects, I encountered challenges in obtaining instrument sounds, especially across multiple octaves. To overcome this obstacle, I crafted my own sound effects using the vibraphone instrument on SoundTrap. Additionally, I've compiled a list of alternative sound options for you to explore and experiment with.

## Code Customization and Cautionary Note

For those who are intrigued and wish to dive deeper, I encourage you to modify the code according to your creative vision. However, I must caution you to exercise care when altering how the notes are played. During my own experiments, I encountered a few hair-raising moments of deafening sounds. Approach with caution and adjust the code responsibly.

## Creative Freedom

Feel free to unleash your creativity and use this creation for any purpose you desire. The possibilities are endless!
